### But there are more confusing terms!

Try checking this [glossary](https://lovesdata.com/blog/google-data-studio-glossary).

---

### Calculating Age

```
=INT(YEARFRAC($BIRTH_DATE_COLUMN2, TODAY()))
```

---

### Working with checkboxes

```
=REGEXMATCH($MULTIPLE_CHOICE_COLUMN2, "some unique choice")
```

```
=REGEXMATCH($MULTIPLE_CHOICE_COLUMN2, "another unique choice")
```

---

### Adding Data from another worksheet

```
=IFERROR(
  INDEX(IMPORTRANGE("GOOGLE_DOCUMENT_ID", "SHEET_NAME!$VALUE_COLUMN$1:$VALUE_COLUMN$100"),
    MATCH($KEY2, IMPORTRANGE("GOOGLE_DOCUMENT_ID", "SHEET_NAME!$KEY_COLUMN$1:$KEY_COLUMN$100"), 0)
  ),
  ""
)
```
